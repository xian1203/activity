# Firebase Integration Setup

This project has been successfully integrated with Firebase! Here's what has been implemented and how to use it.

## 🚀 What's Implemented

### 1. Firebase Configuration
- **File**: `src/lib/firebase.ts`
- **Services**: Authentication, Firestore, Storage
- **Configuration**: Your Firebase project is already configured with the provided credentials

### 2. Authentication System
- **File**: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
- **Features**: Sign in, Sign up, Sign out, User state management
- **Real-time**: Automatically tracks user authentication state

### 3. Firestore Database
- **File**: `src/lib/firestore.ts`
- **Features**: CRUD operations for activities
- **Collections**: `activities` collection with full TypeScript support

### 4. Demo Component
- **File**: `src/components/FirebaseExample.tsx`
- **Features**: Interactive demo of authentication and database operations
- **UI**: Beautiful interface using shadcn/ui components

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/
├── lib/
│   ├── firebase.ts          # Firebase initialization and services
│   └── firestore.ts         # Firestore database operations
├── hooks/
│   └── useAuth.ts           # Authentication hook
├── components/
│   └── FirebaseExample.tsx  # Demo component
└── pages/
    └── Index.tsx            # Updated to include Firebase demo
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### 1. Authentication
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth';

const { user, signIn, signUp, logout } = useAuth();

// Sign in
const result = await signIn(email, password);

// Sign up
const result = await signUp(email, password);

// Sign out
await logout();
```

### 2. Firestore Operations
```typescript
import { firestoreService } from '@/lib/firestore';

// Create activity
const result = await firestoreService.createActivity({
  title: "My Activity",
  description: "Description",
  category: "Exercise",
  duration: 30,
  difficulty: 'medium',
  userId: user.uid
});

// Get all activities
const result = await firestoreService.getActivities();

// Get activities by category
const result = await firestoreService.getActivitiesByCategory("Exercise");
```

### 3. Real-time Features
The authentication hook automatically tracks user state changes and updates the UI in real-time.

## 🎯 Demo Features

The Firebase demo component includes:

1. **Authentication Panel**
   - Email/password sign in
   - Account creation
   - User state display
   - Sign out functionality

2. **Database Operations Panel**
   - Load all activities
   - Create sample activities
   - Display activities with metadata
   - Real-time updates

3. **Error Handling**
   - Toast notifications for success/error states
   - Loading states
   - Input validation

## 🔒 Security Rules

Make sure to set up proper Firestore security rules in your Firebase console:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /activities/{activityId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Enable Authentication Methods**: Go to Firebase Console > Authentication > Sign-in method and enable Email/Password
2. **Set up Firestore**: Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database and create the database
3. **Configure Security Rules**: Set up proper security rules for your collections
4. **Add More Features**: Extend the implementation with:
   - Google/Facebook authentication
   - File uploads to Firebase Storage
   - Real-time listeners for live updates
   - Offline support

## 🛠️ Development

To run the project:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Firebase demo will be available at the top of the main page, allowing you to test all Firebase functionality interactively.

## 📝 Notes

- All Firebase services are properly initialized and exported
- TypeScript types are included for type safety
- Error handling is implemented throughout
- The UI is responsive and follows modern design patterns
- Toast notifications provide user feedback for all operations

Your Firebase integration is now complete and ready to use! 🎉
